Spam Classifier

This is a machine learning-based project that classifies emails into two categories: Spam and Ham (non-spam). The project uses Naive Bayes classification and Count Vectorization to process email data and determine if an email is spam or not.

Project Overview

The Spam Classifier is built using a Naive Bayes machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or ham. It uses the Bag-of-Words technique to convert the email text into a numerical format suitable for machine learning, then applies Multinomial Naive Bayes to predict the class based on word frequencies.

The classifier is trained on two datasets: spam and ham emails. It processes the raw email data, extracts the content, and uses it to train the classifier to detect spam emails.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Scikit-learn for machine learning models
Pandas for data manipulation
Numpy for numerical operations
CountVectorizer for text vectorization
MultinomialNB for Naive Bayes classification
How It Works
Data Collection:

Email files are stored in two directories: emails/spam and emails/ham.
The script reads all email files and processes them into a DataFrame with the message (email content) and class (spam/ham label).
Text Vectorization:

The CountVectorizer is used to convert the email messages into numerical feature vectors based on word counts.
Each email is transformed into a sparse matrix representing the frequency of each word in the vocabulary.
Model Training:

A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is trained using the word count vectors and their respective labels (spam/ham).
The classifier learns the relationship between the words and the email class.
Prediction:

After training, the classifier can be used to predict whether a new email is spam or ham based on its word content.
Setup Instructions
To run this project, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your machine along with the required dependencies.

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/tj003/spam-classifier.git
cd spam-classifier
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you have the emails/spam and emails/ham directories containing your spam and ham email files. The emails should be in text format.

Usage
Train the Model:

Run the spam_classifier.py script to train the model using your email dataset:
bash
Copy code
python spam_classifier.py
Predict a New Email:

After training, you can use the classifier to predict whether an email is spam or ham. Provide the email content as input:
python
Copy code
prediction = classifier.predict([new_email_content])
print(prediction)
Example Output:

The model will output:
spam if the email is classified as spam.
ham if the email is classified as ham.
Results

Once the model is trained, it can classify emails into two categories: Spam and Ham. The performance can be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

To evaluate the model, you can use cross-validation or manually split the data into training and test sets.
